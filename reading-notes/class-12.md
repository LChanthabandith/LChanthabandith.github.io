# Readings: Chart.js, Canvas

## What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?

HTML5 features the `<canvas>` element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

## What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

 The `<canvas>` element requires the closing tag `</canvas>`. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the `<canvas>` element.

## Explain what the `getContext()` method does.

The `<canvas>` element features the `getContext()` method that returns a render context object. The `getContext()` takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the `"2d"` to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface.

## What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options. In addition to a reasonable set of built-in chart types, you can use additional community-maintained chart types . On top of that, it’s possible to combine several chart types into a mixed chart (essentially, blending multiple chart types into one on the same canvas).

## What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly.

## How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

It will make the data or the results easier to read in charts or graphs, rather than in lists.
