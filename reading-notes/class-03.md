## When should you use an `unordered list` in your HTML document?
The '<ul>' element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.

[Usage Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)


## How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?
The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

## When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unorder list` in your HTML document?
The '<ol>' and '<ul>' elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the '<ol>' element, the order is meaningful. To determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the '<ol>' element should be used, otherwise you can use '<ul>'.

## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?

> 'reversed'
This Boolean attribute specifies that the list's items are in reverse order. Items will be numbered from high to low.

> 'start'
An integer to start counting from for the list items. Always an Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, etc.), even when the numbering type is letters or Roman numerals. For example, to start numbering elements from the letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv," use start="4".
