## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as **_semantics_**), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.

## How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
There are six levels of headings, as followed:

- h1

- h2

- h3

- h4

- h5

- h6

## What are some uses for the _sup_ and _sub_ elements?
You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning.

## When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
**_abbr_** is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in _plain text on first use_, along with the **_abbr_** to mark up the abbreviation.

## What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
There are three methods we use to apply CSS to our HTML. The are, as follows:

- External Stylesheet

- Internal Stylesheet

- Inline Styles

## Why should we avoid using inline styles?
It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

## Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
> ### What is representing the selector?
  >**_h2_** is representing the selector
  
> ### Which components are the CSS declarations?
  >The CSS declaration is **_color: black; padding: 5px;_**

> ### Which components are considered properties?
  >The properties are **_color_** and **_padding_**
  
## What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
A **_string_** is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.

## List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). The four types of JavaScript operators are as follows:

- Addition

- Subtraction

- Multiplication

- Division

## Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
You can use a function on a liqour website that requires users to be the age of 21 to enter. The function would be utilized by asking the user to confirm their age before entering the website. If their age registers as 21 and up, they'll be able to use the website however, if their age is below 21, their access will be denied.


## An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
> **_condition_**, **_true_**

## What is the use of an else if?
It is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your _if...else_.

## List 3 different types of comparison operators.
Comparison operators are used to test the conditions inside our conditional statements. Three different types are as follows:

- === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.

- < and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another. 

- <= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

## What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
> - **_AND_**; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
> - **_OR_**; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
