# Readings: Debugging

## Name some key differences between a **Syntax Error** and a **Logic Error**.

- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

- Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I recieved syntax errors in my code when I do not use the correct caplization or spelling within my code. The terminal in VS Code notifies me of the error and I usually just put the correct format for the code to fix the issue.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This topic will help me identify errors in my code and how to correctly debug the issues before submitting them to a client. I believe debugging my code is very useful in my longterm goals in programming because it allows me to be sure my code is efficient and functioning properly.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger is a tool used to inspect and control the execution of your JavaScript code. It lets you pause the code, examine current variables, and step through your code line by line, helping you spot and fix errors or unexpected behavior.

## Define what a breakpoint is.

A point in the code where the execution is intentionally paused so developers can inspect the current state of the program, including variable values and the call stack, to debug or analyze it.

## What is the call stack?

The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
