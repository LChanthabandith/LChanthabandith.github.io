## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL

- Relational (tables/rows)
- Fixed schema
- Uses SQL for queries
- Vertically scalable
- Normalized data structures

NoSQL

- Non-relational (document, key-value, columnar, etc.)
- Dynamic schema
- No standard query language
- Horizontally scalable
- Denormalized or aggregated data structures

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Structured data with defined relationships.

## Give a real world example.

A university student registration system where students, courses, and instructors have defined relationships.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Varied, rapidly-changing, or hierarchical data without fixed schema.

## Give a real world example.

Social media posts with diverse content types like text, images, videos, and varying metadata.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL


## What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

## What is a relational database?

It organizes data into tables related by keys.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Tables with rows and columns.

## What is a ‘schema’?

A blueprint defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of data in a database.

## What is a NoSQL database?

A non-relational database that can store and retrieve data in varied ways.

## How does it work?

It stores data using flexible models like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columns.

## What is inside of a MongoDB database?

Collections of documents stored in a format similar to JSON.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible as because it allows dynamic schemas and can accommodate diverse and changing data structures.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

The lack of a standard query language.
