## Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

Using the … spread operator is a convenient way to copy an array or combine arrays, and it can even add new items:

```
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
```

## Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

The spread operator can add an item to an another array with a natural, easy-to-understand syntax:

```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

## Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

The spread syntax is useful for combining the properties and methods on objects into a new object:

```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

## In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

He defined the function in the parent component.

## In your own words, what does the increment function do?

The increment function increases the value of a variable by a specified amount.

## How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

You can pass a method from a parent component to a child component as a prop.

## How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

The child component can use the method passed from the parent component by getting it through the props and calling it as a function.
