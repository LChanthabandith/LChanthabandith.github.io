## How does HTTP sends data between computers?
**HTTP, _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_**, is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using _TCP/ IP_.

## How can you find images to add to a Website?
All images found through the web can be saved to an _images folder_. Images folder: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder. [Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

# How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
*String:* To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks. _Example: let myVariable = 'Bob'_ [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

*Numbers:* Numbers don't have quotes around them. _Example: let myVariable = 10;_ [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

# What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
*Variables* are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the _let_ keyword, followed by the _name_ you give to the variable. [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

# What is an HTML attribute?
Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
An attribute should have:

-A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
-The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
-An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
