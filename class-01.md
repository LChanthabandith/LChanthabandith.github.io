## How does HTTP sends data between computers?
**HTTP, _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_**, is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using _TCP/ IP_.
