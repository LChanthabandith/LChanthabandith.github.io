## How does HTTP sends data between computers?
**HTTP, _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_**, is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using _TCP/ IP_.

## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
**HTML**  is the code that you use to structure your web content and give it meaning and purpose. [Getting Started with the Web.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

**CSS**, _Cascading Style Sheets_, is the code that you use to style your website. [Getting Started with the Web.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

**JS**, _JavaScript_, is the programming language that you use to add interactive features to your website. [Getting Started with the Web.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

## How can you find images to add to a Website?
All images found through the web can be saved to an _images folder_. Images folder: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder. [Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

# How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
*String:* To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks. _Example: let myVariable = 'Bob'_ [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

*Numbers:* Numbers don't have quotes around them. _Example: let myVariable = 10;_ [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

# What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
*Variables* are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the _let_ keyword, followed by the _name_ you give to the variable. [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

# What is an HTML attribute?
Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
An attribute should have:

-A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)

-The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.

-An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

[Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)

# Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element.
The anatomy of HTML are its elements. The HTML element consist of:
- *Doc Type* _<!DOCTYPE html>_

- *HTML* _<html></html>_

- *Head* _<head></head>_

- *Meta* _<meta charset="utf-8">_

- *Title* _<title></title>_

- *Body* _<body></body>_

# What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
*Article:* The_<article>_ HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable. [Article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)

*Section:* The_<section>_ HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. [Section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)

# What Elements does a “typical” website include?
A typical website should include:

-Header

-Navigation Bar

-Main Content

-Side Bar

-Footer

# How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
Your HTML document will be indexed more effectively by search engines if its language is set (allowing it to appear correctly in language-specific results, for example), and it is useful to people with visual impairments using screen readers. [META](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML)

# How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
Many _<meta>_ elements include name and content attributes:

- _name_ specifies the type of meta element it is; what type of information it contains.

- _content_ specifies the actual meta content.
